This is just a placeholder for software "packaged" using the ancient module system:

The modules shown here are tailored for our specific environment and no support
will be offered.

*** Use it at your own risk ***

You might want to adjust your MODULEPATH environment variable to load those custom/experimental
modules.

export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH:/bubo/home/h5/roman/opt/modules
